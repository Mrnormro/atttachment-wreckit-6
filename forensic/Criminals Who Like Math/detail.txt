A group of hackers, operating in the shadows of cyberspace, plans to steal valuable data from a large company by exploiting an outdated FTP service left vulnerable. One hacker, “Andro,” gains initial access through an intern’s account obtained via a phishing attack, opening the door to sensitive information. However, their plans are interrupted when the FBI tracks them down to their warehouse headquarters, leading to a high-stakes raid. In the chaos of fleeing, one hacker, “Mob,” accidentally drops his phone, which the FBI immediately realizes could hold crucial evidence, potentially unraveling the group's operation.

Help the FBI uncover their next plan!!!
