Aethelred's attack on our quantum research facility was highly sophisticated. The stolen data is not simply lost; it has been sent through unusual channels and protected by multiple layers of obfuscation. Your mission is to investigate the digital evidence. You need to look deeper than expected to find what is hidden, pay attention to unusual network chatter, and uncover the secrets stored in the system's memory. Success means connecting fragments from various sources to reveal the full story of the breach and recover the quantum data.
